# Cryptography
In this repo we explore the different concepts of cryptography

## What is cryptography?
Cryptography is the science of creating secrets.

### Concepts

1. The Hash 
Start with an input and pass it off to a hashing function. This function returns a fixed length value. 
A 'salt' is a random value added to the input before its hashed, making the value it returns much harder to guess.
